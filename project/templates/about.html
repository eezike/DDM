            With this website, users can create accounts and log in. They will then be directed to a profile page and prompted to create a decision.
            On the create page. Users will have the option to enter a binary decion and add as many pieces of additional evidence as they would like. 
            Then, they can go to the feed page. On the feed page is a list of every decison problem any user has made. Site users can answer their own decisions and/or other peoples.
            When answering a decision, you will see evidence one and a time and determine how much that evidence moves you to make choice 1 (valued at -10) or choice 2 (valued at 10).
            Finally, this data will be compiled into a DDM chart that will show your data (in blue) compared to all other users who submitted answers to that particular decision (in gray).

            This project aims to create an engaging and interactive platform for learning about drift diffusion models. Also, the website lets users see how others interpret and respond to the evidence presented in their decisions, which might provide interesting insights into how other people calculate utility.

            By providing a space where users can not only create their own decisions but also observe the responses of others, the website creates a space to explore all types of decision-making processes, allowing users to gain insights into the complexities of decision-making and can refine their own strategies.
            
            Ultimately, this project seeks to demystify the secrets of decision-making while also fostering a sense of community among users as they navigate through various scenarios and analyze the outcomes together.

    <h2 class="title has-text-black">What are Drift-Diffusion Models?</h2>
    <p class="has-text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drift-diffusion models (DDMs) are a powerful tool that can help humans understand the decision-making process by showing decision-making as an accumulation of evidence over time, influenced by both systematic biases (drift) and random fluctuations (diffusion) [1].</p>
    <p class="has-text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sense of this, let us use a simple example: Imagine you're deciding between two flavors of ice cream: chocolate and vanilla. A DDM would represent this decision kind of like a race between two choices. All the subsequent evidence supporting chocolate builds towards the "chocolate" choice, while evidence for vanilla strengthens the "vanilla" choice. The speed at which these choices accumulate evidence represents the drift, with a stronger preference for chocolate leading to a faster drift towards the "chocolate" choice [1].</p>
    <p class="has-text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the decision process isn't perfect. Internal noise, like momentary distractions, can introduce random fluctuations in the evidence accumulation. These fluctuations are captured by the diffusion process, metaphorically like bumps on the road that can slow down one choice or the other momentarily.</p>
    <p class="has-text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the first variable to reach a pre-determined threshold (decision bound) wins the race, and you make your choice. The time it takes to reach the threshold reflects your response time, with a higher drift or less noise leading to faster decisions.</p>

    <h2 class="title has-text-black">DDMs in Action: What Can They Tell Us About Decision-Making?</h2>
    <p class="has-text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DDMs can explain the choice and response time aspects of decision-making. By fitting a DDM to behavioral data, researchers can extract valuable insights such as:</p>
    <ul class="has-text-left bullet-list">
    <li><strong>Decision bias</strong>: The drift rate of a DDM reflects the underlying bias towards a particular choice. A higher drift towards chocolate in the ice cream example suggests a stronger preference for chocolate.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitivity to evidence</strong>: The diffusion coefficient in a DDM indicates how sensitive the decision process is to incoming evidence. A lower diffusion coefficient suggests a more stable and less noisy accumulation of evidence.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision thresholds</strong>: The decision bounds in a DDM represent the level of evidence required to commit to a choice. Higher thresholds can indicate caution, requiring more evidence before making a decision.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategy shifts</strong>: By analyzing changes in drift rates, diffusion coefficients, and decision bounds across different tasks or conditions, researchers can infer how individuals adjust their decision-making strategies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="has-text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DDMs have been applied to a wide range of decision-making tasks, from simple perceptual judgments to complex economic choices. Their ability to capture both the speed and accuracy of decisions makes them a valuable tool for understanding how the mind integrates evidence and arrives at a conclusion [2].</p>
